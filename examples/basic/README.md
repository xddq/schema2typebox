# Example

When schema2typebox is installed (simply issue npm i -g schema2typebox to do
so), clone the repo, cd into this directory and:

- Remove the old generated-schemas.ts file `rm generated-schemas.ts`
- Use schema2typebox to generate the typebox code based on the schema.json file.
  `schema2typebox`
- done ðŸŽ‰

## DEV NOTE

Whenever examples are adapted, please adapt the corresponding test code.

NOTE: perhaps later we should simply load the files from the examples folder
instead of copy pasting it :]:
